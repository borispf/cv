\section{profile}

As an analytical and passionate professional, I hold an academic interest in
formal methods, algorithms and networks. I am looking to develop my skills as
a programmer and to increase my knowledge of developing sound robust software
and esoteric maths while contributing my skills and passion to an innovative
and professional organisation.

I hold a demonstrated ability in computer science and mathematics as shown by
my involvement in the \href{http://www.nzoi.org.nz/} {New Zealand Olympiad in
Informatics}, and competing twice at the International Olympiad in
Informatics in Sofia, Bulgaria and Waterloo, Canada, being awarded a bronze
medal at both. Since then I have volunteered annually at the NZOI's summer
training and selection camp and helped local candidates in their contest
preparations.

Outside of academia, I enjoy playing soccer at the Unicol Football Club's top
mens' Federation team. I also regularly practise pilates and ballroom
dancing.
